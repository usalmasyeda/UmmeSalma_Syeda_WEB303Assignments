    <h2> Brief Overview:</h2>
    <p>Prophet Muhammad, also known as Muhammad ibn Abd Allah, 
        was the founder of Islam and is regarded as the last prophet 
        of Islam. He was born in Mecca in 570 CE (approximately), 
        in what is now Saudi Arabia. His life and teachings have 
        had a profound impact on the world, shaping the religion 
        of Islam and its followers.</p>

                    Prophet Muhammad is believed to have received revelations 
                    from God (Allah) through the angel Gabriel. These revelations,
                     collected in the Quran, are the central religious text of Islam. 
                     The Quran provides guidance on matters of faith, morality, and 
                     law for Muslims.

                    One of the central messages of Prophet Muhammad was the affirmation 
                    of monotheism (the belief in one God) in a society where multiple 
                    deities were worshipped. He called people to worship Allah alone 
                    and reject the worship of idols.

                    Through his teachings, Prophet Muhammad established the foundation for

                    diverse tribal and religious groups under the banner of Islam.

                    serve as a source of guidance for Muslims in matters of daily life.

            In 622 CE, due to growing opposition in Mecca, Prophet Muhammad
             and his followers migrated to Medina. This event, known as the 
             Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic lunar calendar and 
             the establishment of the first Muslim community.

            The Isra and Mi'raj, also known as the Night Journey and Ascension, is one of the miraculous events in the life of Prophet Muhammad.
            According to Islamic tradition, one night, the Angel Gabriel transported Prophet Muhammad from the Kaaba in Mecca to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. From there, he ascended through the heavens, meeting various prophets and ultimately approaching the presence of Allah (God).
            During this journey, he received specific instructions about the daily prayers (Salat), which are central to Islamic worship.
            The Isra and Mi'raj are celebrated by Muslims as a testament to the extraordinary nature of the prophethood of Muhammad and the significance of prayer in Islam.
            It also serves as a reminder of the deep spiritual connection between the earthly and heavenly realms in the Islamic tradition.

                    Prophet Muhammad was born in the year 570 CE in the city of Mecca, 
                    in what is now Saudi Arabia. He belonged to the prominent Quraishi 
                    tribe, specifically the Hashim clan. His father, Abdullah, passed 
                    away before his birth, and his mother, Amina, passed away when he 
                    was six years old. He was raised by his grandfather and later by 
                    his uncle, Abu Talib. Muhammad was known for his honesty and 
                    integrity, earning him the nickname "Al-Amin" (the trustworthy).

                    At the age of 40, Muhammad received his first revelation from Allah 
                    (God) through the Angel Gabriel while he was meditating in the Cave 
                    of Hira. This marked the beginning of his prophethood. Over a period 
                    of 23 years, he received a series of revelations that were compiled 
                    into the Quran, the holy book of Islam.

                    Prophet Muhammad's central message was the belief in the oneness of 
                    God (Tawhid) and the rejection of polytheism and idol worship. He also 
                    emphasized the importance of social justice, compassion, and ethical conduct.
                    He faced significant opposition and persecution from the leaders of Mecca due 
                    to his message, as it challenged the existing order and the polytheistic 
                    practices of the Quraysh.
